Although wireGuard is basically a peer to peer setup, different settings are necessary to let it work as a server to which you can connect to your home from outside and setup as a client to connect to a server e.g. to a commercial VPN provider.  
So for sake of simplicity there are two guides, one for setup a WireGuard server and one for setup a WireGuard client.  
  
The WireGuard server setup guide also has a paragraph about a site-to-site setup connecting two routers.  

The files are in PDF format.   

It is a work in progress, feel free to PM me via the [Openwrt Forum](https://forum.openwrt.org/) with your remarks and suggestions for improvements, you can start a message and send to `egc`.   
Alternatively raise an issue in this repository :)
