# File name: ovpn-update-resolv-9
# Description: Script to grab DNS servers from the tunnel for exclusive use by DNSMasq and routes those via the tunnel to prevent DNS leaks
# Version: 15-may-2024
# Before you start make a backup of your settings just in case
# Install:
#  Copy ovpn-update-resolv-9 from https://github.com/egc112/OpenWRT-egc-add-on/blob/main/stop-dns-leak/use-openvpn-dns/ovpn-update-resolv-9 to /etc/openvpn
#    either from commandline (SSH):
#      curl -o /etc/openvpn/ovpn-update-resolv-9 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egc112/OpenWRT-egc-add-on/main/stop-dns-leak/use-openvpn-dns/ovpn-update-resolv-9
#    or by clicking the download icon in the upper right corner of the script on github and use scp/WinSCP to transfer the file
#  Make executable: chmod +x /etc/openvpn/ovpn-update-resolv-9
#  Add in the OpenVPN config file these two lines:
#   up /etc/openvpn/ovpn-update-resolv-9
#   down /etc/openvpn/ovpn-update-resolv-9
##   script-security 2 #not necessary is default
# Fundamentals:
#  Gets the pushed DNS servers and DNS servers manually set in conf file with: dhcp-option DNS <ip-address-of-DNS-server>
#  DNS servers are set in a new resolv file which is used exclusively by DNSMasq to prevent DNS leaks.
#  Sets route for the DNS servers via the tunnel, necessary when using PBR
#  To stop getting the pushed DNS servers by the OpenVPN server add to conf file: pull-filter ignore "dhcp-option DNS"
#     but if you add this setting then you must add your own DNS servers otherwise you will not have DNS!
#  To set your own DNS servers to use when the tunnel is up, add in the openvpn conf file: dhcp-option DNS ip-address-DNS-server
#  To set your own search domain to use when the tunnel is up, add in the openvpn conf file: dhcp-option DOMAIN my-search-domain
#  When something goes wrong, disable the VPN and restore DNS with: `uci del dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].resolvfile && uci commit dhcp` , and reboot
