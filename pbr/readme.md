This directory contains a test version for PBR.  
Before you start make a backup of your settings and make sure you have a copy of your firmware, you should not need it but better safe then sorry.  
Download the test version: open `pbr-1.1.8-r31-egc-6.bash` and click the download icon in the upper right hand corner.  
On your router, rename the original `/etc/init.d/pbr` script to `/etc/init.d/pbr-org`, and/or copy it to your Desktop  
Copy the new script to `/etc/init.d/pbr`  
Make the new script executable: `chmod +x /etc/init.d/pbr`  
Reboot the computer  

Note that especially Adblock and OpenVPN are slow to setup so adding some delay is often necessary:
```
	option procd_boot_delay '30'
	option procd_reload_delay '20'
	option procd_boot_trigger_delay '9000'    # for build 1.1.8-r30 and after
```
You might need different values, especially if you run Adblock or other resource intensive services you might need to increase the `procd_boot_trigger_delay` to 9000 or (a lot) more, max is 90000.

Alternatively add to `/etc/rc.local` :
```
sleep 60 && service pbr restart
```
