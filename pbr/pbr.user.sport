# name: pbr.user.sport
# usage: accompanying script for PBR: https://docs.openwrt.melmac.net/pbr/ 
# version: 0.3, by egc
# purpose: route sourceports e.g. of VPN servers in your lan via the interface of choice
# installation:
#  copy this file to /usr/share/pbr
#  in this script adapt 'myinterface' to be the interface you want to route your sourceport  
#  in this script adapt'myports' to include all the sourceports you want to route via the interface of choice
#  in this script change 'ip' from "all" to a specific ip address of the source
#  in the PBR GUI add as include file or add in /etc/config/pbr:
#     config include
#	       option enabled '1'
#	       option path '/usr/share/pbr/pbr.user.sport'
#
# check from command line with: 'ip rule show'
